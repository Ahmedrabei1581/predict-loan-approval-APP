# predict-loan-approval-APP
predict loan approval as frit step to know if your loan request can accept or not
Overview
This project aims to assess the financial risk associated with loan approvals using a real-world dataset. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, we analyze applicant information and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of loan approval.

## Project Motivation
Credit risk assessment is crucial for financial institutions to minimize losses and ensure responsible lending. This project explores:
* Key factors influencing loan approval.
* Data-driven approaches to risk evaluation.
* Building a predictive model for automatic loan approval decisions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 20,000 loan applications with 36 features, including demographic, financial, credit, and loan-specific information.
### Key Features
#### Categorical Columns:
* ApplicationDate: Date of application
* EmploymentStatus, EducationLevel, MaritalStatus, HomeOwnershipStatus, LoanPurpose
#### Numerical Columns:
* Personal: Age, Experience, NumberOfDependents, JobTenure
* Financial: AnnualIncome, MonthlyIncome, CreditScore, DebtToIncomeRatio, CreditCardUtilizationRate, NumberOfOpenCreditLines, NumberOfCreditInquiries, BankruptcyHistory, PreviousLoanDefaults, PaymentHistory
* Loan Details: LoanAmount, LoanDuration, BaseInterestRate, InterestRate, MonthlyLoanPayment, TotalDebtToIncomeRatio
* Assets & Liabilities: SavingsAccountBalance, CheckingAccountBalance, TotalAssets, TotalLiabilities, NetWorth
* Other Metrics: MonthlyDebtPayments, UtilityBillsPaymentHistory, RiskScore
#### Target Variable:
* LoanApproved (0 = Denied, 1 = Approved)

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Loading
- Load the dataset using pandas:
[python
import pandas as pd
Loan_approval = pd.read_csv('Loan.csv')]
### 2. Data Preprocessing
* Handle missing values, outliers, and data types.
* Encode categorical variables.
* Scale numerical features using StandardScaler.
### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualize distributions, correlations, and relationships using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.
* Identify key factors affecting loan approval.
### 4. Feature Engineering
*Create new features if necessary (e.g., aggregate ratios, interaction terms).
* Select relevant features for modeling.
### 5. Model Building
* Split data into training and test sets.
* Train a Logistic Regression model (other models can be added).

[[python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
X = Loan_approval.drop('LoanApproved', axis=1)
y = Loan_approval['LoanApproved']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)]]
### 6. Model Evaluation
* Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.
* Analyze feature importance and interpret results.

## How to Run
### 1- Clone the repository:
[bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmedrabei1581/predict-loan-approval-APP.git
cd predict-loan-approval-APP]
### 2- Install dependencies:
[bash
pip install -r requirements.txt]
### 3- Run the notebook:
* Open Financial_Risk_for_Loan_Approval.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab.
* Follow the cells step by step.
### 4- (Optional) Run as script:
* Convert notebook to script or modularize as needed.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* plotly
* scikit-learn
* scipy
## Install all dependencies with:
[bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn scipy]
## Results
* Identified the most influential features for loan approval.
* Built a baseline logistic regression model to predict loan approval.
* Achieved reasonable accuracy (see notebook for details).
* Visualized insights for business and risk teams.
